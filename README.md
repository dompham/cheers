# Cheers.iOS
Cheers is an application and network for craft beer enthusiasts.  Drink great beer, post cheers, get feedback from the app and your network.  Along the way, you can earn achievements and receive useful analytics too!  Should Cheers solidify a userbase, I'd love to make an admin app for brewery and bars to update their tap lists, so that I can leverage the data of a user's taste profile against their beer availability, to make *personalized* beer reccomendations.

### Notes

An iOS project to connect craft beer drinkers.  As a new iOS developer, I decided to choose a few core features that I wanted to learn, then pull it all together for a product that I know (and love).
